# HSDES-LAB02: Embedded Programming on PULP

The goals of this lab session are:
1) Understand how to measure performance statistics on the PULP platform.
2) Profiling Tools (System Traces and [VCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump) Traces)
3) Introduction to PMSIS low-lovel SW libraries
4) PMISIS BSP: dealing with external RAM devices using uDMA and the peripherals (i.e. HyperBus)
5) Double Buffering optimization exploiting the uDMA

A final assignment is described [here]()


## Getting Started
Open a shell and clone the repository with the sample code. 
Remember also to source the PULP-SDK configuration script. 
~~~~~shell
source /pulp/sourceme.sh
cd <working_dir>
git clone https://github.com/mrusci/HSDES-LAB02-PULP_MCU_Performance.git
